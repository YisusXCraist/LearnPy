### Loops ###

#>>>>> While loop

# While loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
#And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed. 
#The while loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration.

my_condition = 0

while my_condition < 10:
    print(my_condition)
    my_condition += 1
# Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# Note: The condition is checked before the loop is executed.
